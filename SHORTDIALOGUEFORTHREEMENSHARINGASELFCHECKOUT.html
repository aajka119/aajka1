class="c2">&nbsp;i&#39;d thought before that i&#39;d seen men standing on other men&#39;s heads, just to get a better look, at what i&#39;m not sure, just a better look, i think that&#39;s all i could think that they&#39;d be doing, looking. always looking quite happily and looking happy while they do it. i once saw a man stacked onto another and a train went by, the man below said up to the man above, that was a close one, but neither man was close to the train, i try not to think of men and their mother&#39;s together, at the same time, not interacting with each other, not even not in the same room, because of this i think that&#39;s always what i&#39;m thinking when i see a man, especially two men stacked one over the other and one man yelling to the other, whether it&#39;s the one above or below that doesn&#39;t matter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">B:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to welcome views aloud, just one man up from usual may truly be something this time of day, more this time of year, when the people come again to try their hands at repentance, if only to stop and shout, i&#39;ve seen enough and with too great a detail, i&#39;m afraid if i were to go on, i wouldn&#39;t ever be the same, what, i do not know, just not the same. maybe well the air up here is not so different, maybe not so hot but still as ever it was. no i don&#39;t think so. maybe well up there it&#39;s gone, as it is down here, a fool&#39;s tale, long since forgotten to those who keep from any channeled alleyways, framed with picked over bins, or from the bicyclists which make with them their living. i&#39;ve known the cob along such paths, merrily, though mistreated by the papers i&#39;d carry with me, scribbling innocent slurs of my dearest friends onto receipts from the week&#39;s spendings. no such thing is really ever known, i&#39;m quite sure there&#39;s much to miss, i&#39;ve known a cob along such paths, though rarely ever was i convinced of my footing, and most certainly not once i&#39;d returned home and observed each step from my back window. </span></p><p

such men, except a painting of a hen i see at the post office. behind the counter is a painting of a hen sitting over her eggs on a painting of a stamp. when i see it i think very much i&#39;d like to stop writing all these pages. i&#39;d like to play air hockey with my ex-wife. i don&#39;t want to mail all these pages to scottsdale. i know what they do with them, they shred them up and use them as substrate in their chicken cages, and the chickens shit all over them. like i can&#39;t shit myself, i&#39;ll shit on my own pages. i see them already covered in shit, i shit words onto them and ship them into scottsdale, i shit words! just the other day i found a small spider crawling by web across my coffee mug. i saw in this spider myself and in the coffee i saw shit, as i so often do, nudging myself along, i blew the spider into the coffee and dumped it out onto the pavement, i said hah! afterwards, it feels good, for once, to be the greater force inside myself, the wind needed to guide myself into the shit. i laughed at myself and i danced around in the puddle. for a writer i haven&#39;t read many books, i haven&#39;t even read any books, i haven&#39;t read my own books, my ex-wife loved books, maybe that&#39;s why i loved her, but she only loved balzac, and he&#39;s a shit head. please place items in the bagging area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;i should say, when one man stands on top of another man, he does so with both feet, and he does so with both feet very close together so they can fit on the other man&#39;s head, and while he stands his toes curl across the top of the other man&#39;s forehead, and he leaves his arms to the side, also touching but not each other touching the sides of his torso but he often wears athletic shorts, the kinds which don&#39;t have pockets because he has also an athletic locker, but with his hands and arms to his sides and with his toes curled he maintains a most animated head, it swivels around his neck like an owls head, and sometimes these two men will stop at trees, and from the trees the top man will pick for seeds, whether or not these bird habits are inherent within these men,,, i haven&#39;t any idea, i do not know their intentions only that they look happy when they do so, sometimes the top man will step down and let up the bottom man and when this happens they look even happier, the new bottom man will keep his head still and look up with only his eyes and grin while the new top man picks at seeds and they will walk away afterwards feeling full. you rarely see these men by the beach, because they cannot walk so well in the sand, if you do happen to see them by the beach you could assume it&#39;s because they are new to walking like this, maybe not to thought but to it&#39;s practice, because maybe they have just recently found a partner with which they will learn to walk in tandem. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">SC:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;please place

new years eve, chaos of snow and mud churned up by a million honda civics!. i too find in coffee an impalpable excrement, an unbridled glee enough to leave full lines of traffic cascading towards the ocean&#39;s floor. i do however find this in so many things, so many soft drinks and candy bars. i dream of the day i will, while walking, watch a man take his own life with a twix. </span></p><p

dictates to a table of dinner guests his self-supported qualities he will only die once he&#39;s said so, and afterwards he&#39;ll say again. he&#39;ll say &quot;i&#39;ve died but do try to get on without me. i know it won&#39;t be easy &nbsp;and i&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be pleasant. but do try. do try for me.&quot; such modern men have been so modern for only hundreds of years, and here&#39;s to hundreds more, for modern man is infinitely interchangeable and infinitely unchanged. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p

summer&#39;s breeze! he looks quite comfortable as he gasps, as he weeps, and when he&#39;s buried in his shorts. a summer&#39;s breeze to kiss those budding knees, budding once with hops and leaps, but only now by a chemically slowed decomposition. grey&#39;s looking rosey in his shit eating face, perhaps someday we&#39;ll dress even our cadavers as school children, i don&#39;t see why not, perhaps we&#39;ll ship them into scottsdale to fertilize our deserts. the world needs more substrate. if only my father had told me &quot;son, the world needs more substrate. now climb into that paper

prescriptive curse, in all it&#39;s expedience and rapidity, to those who spiral round the promises of life. much like a top on which someone&#39;s glued a siren. sent across a sink without chance to plug the drain. why did the capitalist beat his wife&#39;s head with a bottle of champagne during their first attempt at contractual coitus? he does this with all his new boats. and what of their second attempt? if we assume she forfeits to his relentless demands. she returns this time as a boat wearing a helmet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c1"><span
